# Worship Pursuit

## Synopsis

Worship Pursuit is starting out as a mailing list that people can join to recieve weekly emails geared towards helping them deepen their relationship with God and cultivate their heart of worship.

## Code

This repository is really only a storage place for me to work on the website from anywhere without commiting the changes to the public website.

## Motivation

This project stemmed from a desire to help my worship team grow spiritually. I started with a mailing list that is automated to send to them weekly as I write, and have felt that it is time to make those emails publicly available. Currently I plan to continue using Mail Chimp for distribution and list organization. This website will have a landing page, about page, signup page, and share page.

## Contributors

I hope to build a team of contributers for content for the mailing list itself. Suggestions on website improvements are always welcome as well. Just make a comment @tlamarca to share your thoughts and suggestions.
